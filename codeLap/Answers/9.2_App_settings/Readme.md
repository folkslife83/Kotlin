# 9.2: App settings

* Task 1: Add a switch setting to an app -->*(Project: AppWithSettings)*
* Task 2: Use the Settings Activity template -->*(Project: DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidSupportVersion and DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidX)*
* Coding challenge -->*(Project: DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidX)*
* Homework -->*(Project: DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidXHW)*

Notes
1. There are 2 projects for task 2. DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidSupportVersion uses the now deprecated android support libraries whereas DroidCafeWithSettingsAndroidX uses Android Jetpack's androidx libraries. 
2. Coding challenge requires the up navigation to work properly. This error is addressed when using AndroidX and therefore no changes are required.
3. Homework uses AndroidX libraries.
