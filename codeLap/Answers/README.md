* __Gradle Version:__ 4.4 and above

All apps in this repository are made using java.

Projects for section 1.1 to 3.3 are from version 1 of the course. Not repeated because of similarities. These projects are mostly the same as version 2 but with minor changes. Projects after section 3.3 are from version 2 of the course. 
Some projects (section 9.2 onwards) use AndroidX libraries instead of the deprecated Android Support libraries.

All homework question and answers are in the MainActivity.java file of the homework projects.

The repository is complete and all projects work properly as intended.
