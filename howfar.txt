03.2: Unit tests // challenge 
https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-unit-tests?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#4
Challenge 2: Sometimes it's difficult to isolate a unit of code from all of its external dependencies. Rather than organize your code in complicated ways just so you can test it more easily, you can use a mock framework to create fake ("mock") objects that pretend to be dependencies. Research the Mockito framework, and learn how to set it up in Android Studio. Write a test class for the calcButton() method in SimpleCalc, and use Mockito to simulate the Android context in which your tests will run.
